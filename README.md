# Driving Mileage
 
I have logged my weekly driving mileage for just over a year. The goal was to use the data for an introductory project of time seies ideas and applications. During the time frame of collecting data, the Covid-19 pandemic started. This provided a unique opportunity to not only explore a time series dataset, but analyze the effect of exogenous factors on a time series. 

The data span from August 12, 2019 to December 13, 2020. Data are collected evey Monday. The data represent the mileage driven over the previous seven days, e.g. Monday to Sunday. Therefore, the first observation is dated August 19, 2019, which accounts for the week of August 12, 2019 to August 18, 2019, and the last observation is December 14, 2020, which accounts for the week of December 7, 2020 to December 13, 2020. 

[This analysis](https://github.com/Mike-Jarmola/Driving_Mileage/blob/main/Mileage_Analysis.ipynb) steps through a data science time series project by:

1) Identifying and imputing missing values
2) Testing stationarity
3) Analyzing Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation charts
4) Estimating an ARIMA model
5) Accounting for exogenous effects

We find that the Covid-19 pandemic and if I travel outside my Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area account more for my driving mileage than mileage driven in previous weeks. 

Thank you for reading, and I welcome any feedback and comments!
