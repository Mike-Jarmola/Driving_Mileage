# Driving Mileage
 
I have logged my weekly driving mileage for just over a year. The goal was to use the data for an introductory project of time seies ideas and applications. During the time frame of collecting data, the Covid-19 pandemic started. This provided a unique opportunity to not only explore a time series dataset, but analyze the effect of exogenous factors on a time series. 

The data span from August 12, 2019 to December 13, 2020. Data are collected evey Monday. The data represent the mileage driven over the previous seven days, e.g. Monday to Sunday. Therefore, the first observation is dated August 19, 2019, which accounts for the week of August 12, 2019 to August 18, 2019, and the last observation is December 14, 2020, which accounts for the week of December 7, 2020 to December 13, 2020. 

[This analysis](https://github.com/Mike-Jarmola/Does_Bobby_Flay_Always_Win/blob/master/Does_Bobby_Flay_Always_Win_Analysis.ipynb) proves that Bobby is beatable. Not only beatable, but we identify Bobby's strengths and weakness, from which dishes defeat Bobby to which Guests and Judges have strong records against Bobby. 

 This project is an attempt to combine my two hobbies, eating and data science. I welcome any feedback and comments!
 
 The data are collected from [Beat Bobby Flay Wikipedia website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Bobby_Flay). We look at seasons 1 - 24. As of this writing, season 24 is the most recent complete season; thus, we stop the analysis here.
